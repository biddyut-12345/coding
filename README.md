    <p>Hey Jupi, I've been captivated by your smile from the moment I saw it. It's the kind of smile that lights up the whole room and makes my day brighter. I really like you, and I hope you'll say yes to being mine!</p>
    <p>What do you say?</p>
    <button class="yes" onclick="alert('Yay! I\'m so happy! Let\'s celebrate!')">Yes! 😊</button>
    <button class="no" onclick="alert('Oh no! But I\'ll keep trying to win you over with my charm!')">No 😢</button>
